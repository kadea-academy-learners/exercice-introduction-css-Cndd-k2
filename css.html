        <h2> Here's a timeline of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2>
        <ul class="timeline">
            <li>1914 - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
            <li>1933 - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression-era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
            <li>1935 - Takes up school again and saves more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. “I saw how food changed them,” he said. “All of this left scars on me.”</li>
            <li>1937 - Finishes university and takes a job in the U.S. Forestry Service</li>
            <li>1938 - Marries wife of 69 years, Margaret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school to study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistant plants.</li>
            <li>1941 - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asks his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
            <li>1942 - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
            <li>1944 - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease-resistant wheat, including varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
            <li>1945 - Discovers a way to grow wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
            <li>1953 - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yielding American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
            <li>1962 - visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding wheat strains to the Indian subcontinent, helping to prevent mass starvation due to a rapidly growing population.</li>
            <li>1970 - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
            <li>1983 - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields</li>
            <li>1984 - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
            <li>2005 - states, "We will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way to meet this demand, adding that "we’ve been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science."</li>
            <li>2009 - dies at the age of 95</li>
        </ul>
